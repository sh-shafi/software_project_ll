    <p>"It'll be an awfully long day," said Robin.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Peter and Jan.</p>

    <p>"We'd better <i>do</i> something then," said Robin.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Peter and Jan again.</p>

    <p>
      But it was difficult to know exactly <i>what</i> to do! For to-day was the
      day on which the Lennox cousins were to arrive-Dick and Donald, who had
      been invited to spend the last weeks of the holidays with the Vaughans.
      The Vaughans had been looking forward to this day immensely, but now it
      had come at last they felt that they could hardly get through the hours
      before their visitors would actually arrive. There would be "tons of
      things," as Peter said, "to do <i>then</i>," but there seemed nothing to
      do to-day.
    </p>

    <p>"Let's go over to the Island," said Robin at last.</p>

    <p>
      The island lay in the middle of the river that flowed at the bottom of the
      Vaughans' garden; it was only the work of a few minutes to pull across to
      the wooded little place where Brown the gardener had his cottage, but
      where, otherwise, the birds had it pretty much to themselves, as Jan said.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the Vaughans were tremendously hard workers; Robin was entered for his
      first real exam.; Peter and Jan were each head of their forms at their
      respective schools, and "meant to keep head." Thus the Island certainly
      <i>was</i>
      left to the birds except in the holidays; but-a holiday camp was to be one
      of the tremendous pleasures ahead when the Lennoxes came.
    </p>

    <p>
      "For they're Scouts, you see, like us, so they're sure to be keen," Robin
      had said, in appealing to his mother.
    </p>

    <p>"It'll be such awfully good practice," Peter had gone on.</p>

    <p>"And, as I'm a Guide--!" Jan had begun.</p>

    <p>
      Mrs. Vaughan had laughed; she was a "jolly good mother for Scouts and
      Guides to have," as the boys and girls declared, because "she never
      fussed." She trusted them and left them to themselves, so that they might
      learn "self-reliance," as she told them. After she had laughed, however,
      on this occasion she shook her head. "I have no objection to your camping
      out for a night or two," she said. "After all, Robin camped with his troop
      last year, and the holiday won't have done much for him if he can't
      captain the rest of you over on the Island, but--"
    </p>

    <p>"Oh, <i>Mother</i>!" said Jan, who guessed what was coming.</p>

    <p>
      "Yes, I won't have Jan sleeping out of doors. Pneumonia two years ago, you
      remember, Jan? Or perhaps you don't,-you were too small; but-I
      <i>do</i>! No, Jan may choose either to sleep at home and join the boys by
      day, or-" Mrs. Vaughan wrinkled her brow-"perhaps Gardener's wife, Mrs.
      Brown, has a spare room. Yes, of course she has. Now, Jan, would you feel
      more on the spot and more of a regular camper if I could arrange for you
      to sleep in the Island Cottage?" "Oh, yes." Jan's eyes sparkled with
      delight.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And the Lennox boys are Scouts too, so they'll be willing enough, I've no
      doubt," went on Mrs. Vaughan. "In fact I mentioned something of the plan
      to your aunt, and she seemed very pleased. Well, I think it can be
      arranged, but-it would be well to wait for really settled weather,
      wouldn't it?"
    </p>

    <p>"The wind's in a good quarter <i>now</i>," Peter had said.</p>

    <p>
      That had been yesterday, and the Lennoxes were coming in a few hours. It
      had been decided, though, that for a day or two the newcomers should sleep
      at the Chase and be introduced to the interests that the house and garden
      afforded. "You must remember," as Mrs. Vaughan told the children,
      "everything will be new and interesting to them. It is the first time they
      have been to the Chase, and the house will mean a good deal to them as
      belonging to their mother's family for so many generations. They may not
      want to camp out just at once, and--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "It's queer, isn't it?" said Peter to the others as they made their way
      over to the Island, "to think that they've never yet seen the house,
      though Father is their uncle, and everything!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "That's because they've always lived so far north," said Robin, "though it
      isn't as though the Chase is as it used to be, <i>then</i>-in the old days
      I mean. They'll understand that, though; they must have heard--" he
      sighed. "It must have been rippingly jolly," he said, "to live here in the
      old days."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is-<i>now</i>," said Jan loyally; but she and Peter knew what Robin
      meant. For the Chase had been the home of the Vaughan family for
      generations; it was an old rambling place standing in large grounds, but,
      ever since the children could remember, most of the house had been shut up
      and empty. Stories of the old days when their father and his sister had
      been young-before the change of fortunes had come which had made
      everything so different-were interesting to hear, if a little strange to
      understand.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I often wonder," said Jan, when they were making their way across to the
      Island for another look at the camping ground on which they had fixed,
      "exactly what the mystery was."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I do, too. But Dad never told us. When War's over, and he's back, perhaps
      he will. We'll be older," said Robin. "It's-a family secret, something to
      do with something that happened. It killed Grandfather, I believe. He died
      of a broken heart, or something. There was lots of money to pay, too,
      and-the Chase has been pretty nearly all shut up ever since, but--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I think it's strange," said Jan, "and <i>I</i>
      think it'd be better to tell us. We might help, you know. Oh, of course I
      know we all work frightfully hard at school because we're to bring back
      the family fortunes, but there are things I want to know about. There's a
      gap in the gallery where a picture's been taken down,-in between the
      portraits of Dad and Aunt Agnes when they were children,-Mother wouldn't
      tell me why. Not that I'd ask again, but--"
    </p>

    <p>"Perhaps the Lennoxes will know," suggested Peter.</p>

    <p>
      "If they do, I'm not sure that we ought --" Robin was beginning when the
      sound of a horn was heard. It was Mrs. Vaughan's signal to the children
      when they were on the Island that they were wanted at once at home. At its
      sound the three turned their steps back to the boat, and in a few minutes
      Robin and Peter were pulling across. "Oh, my dears," said their Mother,
      standing on the opposite bank, her face quite pale with anxiety, "<i
        >such</i
      >
      an unexpected thing has happened!"
    </p>

    <br /><br /><br />

    <h3 style="text-align: center" id="chapter-02">CHAPTER II</h3>

    <p>"Whatever is it, mother?" asked Robin anxiously.</p>

    <p>
      For Mrs. Vaughan's face was quite pale with worry as she stood on the bank
      while they rowed towards her. "Don't pull right in," she said. "Though I
      suppose it doesn't matter out of doors. It's-- Better not, perhaps, under
      the circumstances. Stay there-on the water, and I'll talk to you from
      here."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why! What-ever--!" The eyes of the three grew large and round. Then an
      awful idea struck Peter. "Mother, you don't mean to say that anything's
      happened. You talk as though we'd got the Plague! Whatever is it?" He
      racked his brain to think of some possible horror. "Well, it isn't that
      the Lennoxes have wired to say that they can't come, for, if so--!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "It's-worse." Mrs. Vaughan laughed ruefully. "One of them has arrived.
      It's-Dick; but-oh, he's <i>covered</i> with spots! Came out in the train,
      so he says; and, poor boy, he's feeling pretty bad, I think. It's certain
      to be something infectious, particularly as Donald-so Dick says-has been
      kept at home for a day or two, because this morning he woke up with a
      terrible headache, and wasn't well enough to travel."
    </p>

    <p>"Measles! Well, we've had them!" said</p>

    <p>Robin hopefully.</p>

    <p>
      "So have they. I greatly fear that it's scarlet fever. The poor boy is
      terribly annoyed with himself for coming, but how could they think of such
      a thing as scarlet fever? No; I pity his mother-so far away-as much as I
      pity myself. I've sent for Dr. Greig, and, in the meantime, you had better
      all three stay over on the Island for tea. Get Gardener's wife to give you
      some, and explain to her. I'm so sorry, dears, that all this has just
      happened when you had planned such a happy time."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sorry for <i>us</i>! It's <i>you</i>-and Dick, of course," said Robin.
      "Cheero, mother; let us help. Scouts know all about First Aid!"
    </p>

    <p>"So do Guides," added Jan quickly.</p>

    <p>
      "First Aid is not needed for scarlet fever. None of you have had it, you
      know; and there's your exam. ahead, Robin. You can't run risks. No, I only
      called you to tell you; for you must keep out of the way till the Doctor's
      told me definitely what it is. I'll blow the horn again as soon as I've
      news." Their mother waved her hand and was gone.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Wheww!" said Robin; and they rowed in silence to the other side of the
      water. In an instant their castle of hopes was in bits, and their holiday
      seemed spoilt. "If I wasn't a Scout I'd feel inclined to-jolly well--!"
      Peter vented his feelings in kicking up a huge clod of turf as he stepped
      ashore.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And if I wasn't a Guide, I'd--" Jan's voice sounded pretty near to tears.
    </p>

    <p>
      "No cousins-or as bad as none; perhaps worse, for Mother'll be worked to
      death," continued Peter; "all our ripping preparations spoilt! No camp--!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Steady on!" called Robin; he could have grumbled a bit himself, easily
      enough, but he wasn't going to. He had been thinking hard instead, and he
      broke out suddenly: "I've got an idea. No, I won't say what it is till I
      know if it's needed. Don't give up hopes of the camp yet, and let's go
      meanwhile and ask Brownie about tea."
    </p>

    <p>
      The gardener's house, to which they turned their steps rather dejectedly,
      was a very old stone cottage, as old as the Chase itself. It had been used
      for generations as the home of one or other of the keepers, having been
      built in a convenient place, so it was said, for the operations of
      possible river-poachers to be watched. Old Brown the gardener, though he
      had been in the service of the family all his life, had only lived in the
      cottage for about fifteen years. With the fall of the family fortunes the
      outdoor as well as the indoor staff of the Chase had been reduced, and at
      present he was a regular handy-man, the only man, indeed, about the place.
      His wife welcomed the three comfortably enough; and under the soothing
      influence of Brownie's scones and home-made jam their spirits began to
      rise. By the time the "third cup" stage was reached they were able at last
      to unburden themselves to their kind-hearted listener.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We'd expected such <i>lots</i> of fun when the Lennoxes came," said
      Peter.
    </p>

    <p>"Sure, my dear," said Brownie, nodding commiseratingly.</p>

    <p>
      "They're sure to be jolly, you see, being relations!" said Jan
      ingenuously; "and besides"-heedless of a warning touch from Robin, who
      didn't believe in talking over family matters, she went on confidingly-"we
      somehow hoped they might know what the mystery is. You know, Brownie, at
      least, but I don't suppose you've ever thought about it--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "<i>Have</i> you?" asked Peter suddenly, as the old woman did not answer,
      but rose busily to poke the fire.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sure, my dear, and having been in service at the House before ever I
      married Brown--" began the old body a little confusedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I say," Robin broke in, "look here, Jan and Peter. And, Brownie, I'm not
      sure--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "There's the horn!" interrupted Peter suddenly. The clear sound came
      faintly over the water.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Aye, the horn it is, sure enough," said Brownie in a relieved voice, "and
      hadn't you better be going to see?"
    </p>

    <p>
      But she spoke to an empty kitchen: the three were gone. Down to the
      water's side they raced, and were just pushing off when their mother began
      to call to them. "You needn't come over; I can speak from here. Yes, it
      <i>is</i>
      what I feared. Dr. Greig says there's no mistake about it. And Donald says
      that there was a case in his form at school. Now, what I'm to do with you
      I don't know."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mother," began Robin, "listen; I know a tremendously good way out of the
      difficulty."
    </p>

    <p>"What is it?" inquired Mrs. Vaughan.</p>

    <p>
      "It's nothing more nor less than the camp!" said Robin; "and, if you'll
      stay there for an instant, I'll row over and tell you what I mean."
    </p>

    <br /><br /><br />

    <h3 style="text-align: center" id="chapter-03">CHAPTER III</h3>

    <p>
      "It's like this," said Robin, as he hung over the side of the boat, "at
      first I thought we couldn't do anything, but we <i>can</i>. It's stupid to
      suggest that we should come and nurse Dick, because we'd be sure to catch
      it, and give miles more trouble. Even if we <i>don't</i> nurse him,
      there'll be the chance of infection. So-suppose we stay <i>here</i>!"
    </p>

    <p>"My dear boy," began Mrs. Vaughan, "but--"</p>

    <p>
      "Don't 'but,' Mother; <i>do</i> listen. We were to have a camp, weren't
      we? Well, let's begin at once. I suppose Dick and his spots are now in the
      bedroom leading out of Peter's and mine, so it's jolly likely--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes," Mrs. Vaughan nodded her head. "I put him there before I had
      realised--. Then, as he <i>had</i> infected the place, I thought he'd
      better stay. I meant to move him to one of the unoccupied rooms, but so
      far I haven't managed it, and--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well then, think of my idea. If we move into the house we'll be in
      quarantine when term begins. No one-not even school-could say we've been
      near infection if we stay here. There's Brown's house, too, if--"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mrs. Vaughan's face was beginning to clear: "You'd promise not to sleep
      out if it were wet? I'm sure Brownie would arrange for Jan, and anything
      you might want. Well, Robin-I'm not so sure that your plan
      <i>isn't</i> a good one after all. And, if it <i>does</i> work, it will be
      a decided help to me."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Hurray!" shouted Robin. "Hurray!" shouted the other two. This was Robin's
      plan, was it? they thought; well, it was a jolly good one. Peter waved an
      oar in the air.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Listen though," said their mother anxiously, "for if I <i>am</i> going to
      allow it, I have any amount to say first."
    </p>

    <p>
      But in half an hour every single thing was arranged. Jan, despatched to
      fetch Brownie, appeared in due course with the old woman, who seemed as
      "adaptable as a jolly old glove," as Peter said, hugging her. She was
      delighted to provide the campers with food and anything that they might
      need, and was overjoyed that there was a possibility of "Miss Jan" staying
      at the cottage. "And in bad weather, the young gentlemen too! Yes, ma'am,
      to be sure," said Brownie. "But-" her voice sounded a little fearful and
      dubious as she spoke-"there's only the attic, ma'am, with the sloping
      roof; they wouldn't be fr--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of course not." Mrs. Vaughan's voice sounded almost impatient; she broke
      off hastily, and Brownie said no more. "Really, Robin," declared his
      mother, with a change of tone, "I don't know what I should do without you.
      It seems a very good plan. Now, if only the weather--"
    </p>

    <p>"Wind's in the right quarter," said Peter, with sparkling eyes.</p>

    <p>
      "And-you'll blow your horn every day after breakfast, Mother," begged Jan,
      "and come and talk to us, won't you? We won't come to the house at all,
      but we'll send letters by Brown."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Very well, good-bye till to-morrow." Mrs. Vaughan turned, looking greatly
      relieved.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good luck to Dick; and take care of yourself, Mother," shouted the three
      as she disappeared, waving her hand at the bend of the path.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And <i>now</i>, what are we to do?" inquired Peter of his older brother.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'll jolly well show you <i>that</i>, old chap," said Robin. "We've got
      to pitch a camp, and that pretty quickly too, for arrangements have taken
      time. It's fortunate that we decided on the site; but we've got to make
      our sleeping-place, you know."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Better sleep to-night in the large attic, Master Robin, perhaps,"
      suggested Brownie, but she looked relieved at the boys' emphatic refusal
      of her offer. The attic wanted clearing out; no one had slept there since
      the Browns took possession, and it was a veritable ark of lumber. "And
      I've Miss Jan's room to get ready," thought the old woman.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jan herself was only too eager to help the boys in their preparations; a
      camper she intended to be from morn till eve; only for the nights would
      she condescend to the shelter of a roof. Guide as she was, too, her
      services proved invaluable; with the boys she collected fuel for the fire
      as to the manner born; dry bark and chips were collected for kindling
      purposes, and larger pieces of dead wood for the blaze later on. The sun
      was not strong enough at that time in the afternoon for the fire to be
      lighted by the help of the burning-glass that Robin always carried, but a
      single match sufficed in his practised hands; then, when the flame was
      safely spluttering, he left the fire to the tender mercies of his sister,
      and the two boys turned their attention to the preparation of a
      sleeping-place.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It's miles too late to get through with a real hut," said Robin. "We're
      likely to be on this Island for a while, and we might spend some of our
      time in building a real good one. What do you say to working up for our
      Pioneer Badge while we're here, Peter? Good idea, don't you think?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Peter nodded; he was rather unusually silent, and was evidently thinking
      something out.
    </p>

    <p>
      "For to-night we'd better see about a temporary shelter"-Robin was busily
      engaged in pulling armfuls of bracken as he spoke; "there's a likely
      tree-trunk over there, and we might lay one of our staves against that
      fork that comes some way up the trunk. We'll need a jolly lot of bracken
      to thatch it across, so you and Jan had better both come along here and
      pull some. It'll be better than sleeping in the attic to spend the night
      under the stars."
    </p>

    <p>
      Peter nodded again; then he spoke. "About that attic, Robin," he said,
      "didn't you twig from the way Brownie spoke, that there is something
      mysterious about the place?"
    </p>

    <br /><br /><br />

    <h3 style="text-align: center" id="chapter-04">CHAPTER IV</h3>

    <p>
      "I never knew such a chap as you for getting ideas into your head," said
      Robin. "Mysterious! Why? you've got mysteries on the brain, it seems to
      me!"
    </p>

    <p>"Be prepared!" quoted Peter with twinkling eyes.</p>

    <p>
      "Oh, all serene; but 'be prepared' for to-night too, if you've no
      objection," the old campaigner spoke dryly. "You don't exactly want to get
      a chill before morning, do you, and be compelled to sleep at the Cottage
      till the end of the camp?"
    </p>

    <p>
      This idea struck Peter as sound; he fell to, therefore, with a will. Jan
      came along, too, having first set one of the boys' dixies on the now
      blazing camp-fire. "Suppose you'll want your supper after this, won't
      you?" she asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Rather, I should say so," but the two boys were too busy to talk much.
      Already the night shelter was beginning to look quite professional. One of
      the scout-staves was laid against and bound to the trunk of a straight
      young tree; the framework thus formed was thatched very closely with leafy
      boughs and bracken, and the whole bivouac was complete.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It's simply perfect," remarked Jan, surveying the results of their
      labours with glowing eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And perfectly simple," added Peter; but Robin, as Captain of the campers,
      was anxious to set them both to work again as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We've got the temporary shelter pitched all right," he said, "with its
      back away from the wind; but we'll want a trench dug all round it. Suppose
      there's heavy rain in the night, and we get flooded out! Not that I think
      there will be, but we'll be prepared."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Now I see why you would have the camp on a slope, old chap," said Peter,
      coming up. "The trench will carry the water straight down to the river.
      Jolly neat idea."
    </p>

    <p>
      The digging of the small ditch took the rest of the boys' energies; about
      three inches deep they made it. Meanwhile Jan installed herself as
      camp-cook, and began preparations for the first meal of all. After a
      flying visit to Island Cottage she returned with a saucepan, a jug of
      milk, and a loaf of bread, as well as three new-laid eggs. The milk was
      boiled in the saucepan, and the eggs were cooked in the dixie of hot
      water. Jan was trying her best to make three slices of rather smoky toast,
      and burning her cheeks badly in the endeavour, when the boys-their labours
      over for a time-approached the camp-fire.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppers are nearly always welcome; but this particular supper was voted
      the rippingest on record. And, afterwards, as the day slowly faded to
      dusk, the three sat in the firelight saying very little but enjoying,
      every one of them, the magic of the late summer evening in their own
      particular way. The spell was broken at last by a little shiver from Jan,
      and Robin jumped up. "Here, it's time we fetched a rug or two, Peter, from
      the Cottage. And, Jan, Brownie will have your room ready by this time. We
      will take you home, and then we'll turn in ourselves."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mrs. Brown was on the look-out for the three. "I've got Miss Jan's room
      ready," she announced, "but I suppose you young gentlemen are sleeping
      out? What with the lumber in that attic, my dears, I've not--!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "It's all right, Brownie, we've just come for blankets," the boys assured
      her. "We'll help to turn out the attic ourselves on the first wet day.
      Don't worry about that, and thank you for the milk and eggs and things;
      they made a ripping supper, and they'll make a ripping breakfast too. But
      from then we'll be self-supporting. We can row over to the other side of
      the river for what things we need, and we'll be about, you know, if you
      want any odd jobs done." The boys, armed with a rug apiece, shouted a
      cheery good-night and were off again campwards, while Jan followed her
      hostess into the bedroom that had been prepared for her.
    </p>

    <p>
      She went to the window when she was ready for bed and looked out; at first
      it seemed quite dark outside, but the moon was shining on the river
      between the Island and the Chase garden, and a bridge of moonlight seemed
      to span the water. Suddenly another light appeared too, a steady light
      from one of the windows of the Chase. "It's Mother, I expect," thought Jan
      sleepily. "She's lighted it for us to see. I wonder if the boys see it
      too. And I wonder if Mother--" she jumped into bed and curled herself up
      in the big old-fashioned feather mattress, and was asleep in a twinkling.
    </p>

    <p>
      The boys were fast asleep already too. It hadn't taken long to cover the
      fire with ashes, and to collect a few logs in case a midnight stoking was
      required. Then they rolled themselves in their rugs and turned over, their
      feet towards the fire. Hours and hours seemed to have passed when Robin
      was suddenly awakened. "I say, old chap," said Peter's voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What's wrong?" asked Robin sleepily; it was quite dark-for the moon had
      set early-perhaps the darkest part of the summer night.
    </p>

    <p>"Don't you hear rather a peculiar noise?" inquired Peter.</p>

    <p>"No! What sort?" Robin raised himself on his elbow to listen.</p>

    <p>
      "A sort of thumping." Peter sat up too. "No, it's gone again. But it was
      quite loud-it woke me, and I thought--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "You've been dreaming, old chap," said Robin sleepily; "it's nothing at
      all." He closed his eyes as he spoke and drew a deep breath, and after a
      minute or two his younger brother followed his example. "Suppose it
      <i>must</i> have been a dream," he muttered as he drifted off, "but--"
      There was a snore-Peter, too, was fast asleep.
    </p>

    <br /><br /><br />

    <h3 style="text-align: center" id="chapter-05">CHAPTER V</h3>

    <p>
      Both boys seemed to waken at the same instant next morning. The birds were
      singing all round them; the light was dancing on the river; the Chase
      stood out before them framed in a cloudless blue sky, and the camp-fire
      was practically out!
    </p>

    <p>
      But a little energy soon put that right. A few red-hot cinders still
      remained, and last night's heap of dead wood served as morning fuel. Very
      soon the fire was crackling away merrily enough. "Isn't this A1 and O.K.?"
      shouted Peter, splashing in the river. "Hurray and Hurroosh! Oh, isn't a
      night-camp grand? I could eat my breakfast, though, at any minute you like
      to name."
    </p>

    <p>
      "We'll have to catch and cook it first," said his brother. But when, after
      a ten minutes' swim, the boys returned to the camp-fire it was to find
      Jan, the good fairy, in charge. "Breakfast at the Cottage for <i>me</i>!"
      she repeated indignantly; "what an idea! I'm camping out as much as you
      are! I'm cook, too, aren't I? No,-if you'll only just go off for five
      minutes and fetch fuel or something, I'll have hot tea ready by then."
    </p>

    <p>
      In five minutes she was as good as her word; a dixie full of hot tea for
      each awaited them, and the remains of the loaf and the butter. "There's
      not very much," Jan announced to the approaching pair, "but I thought we
      wanted to be self-supporting now we've begun, so I just brought a few
      tea-leaves along, and--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Right you are. So we will be"-the boys produced a pretty good cupful of
      wild raspberries. "If we can't make a good breakfast on these--!" they
      said. And the meal in the open air, of bread and butter and wild fruit,
      was not to be despised. Hardly was it over when the horn sounded on the
      other side of the water. "There's Mother. We'll tidy up the camp and make
      up to-day's arrangements when we've heard what she has to say," said Robin
      as they raced off.
    </p>

    <p>
      The morning bulletin was good. Dick's attack was evidently slight-he had
      had a good night; and it seemed a very mild sort of scarlet fever, so the
      children's mother informed them. "He doesn't seem to have caught cold on
      the journey, for which I am thankful; but the queer thing is that Donald
      <i>hasn't</i> got it, evidently, after all. His headache was a bilious
      attack. Your aunt writes that he will travel to-morrow. I shall have to
      wire to put him off, of course, but it's just possible that he may escape
      altogether."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I say, if he <i>does</i>, what a time he'll have! No Dick; no us; no
      holiday; no nothing!" said Peter commiseratingly. "Poor chap, he's worse
      off than us."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, indeed," Mrs. Vaughan smiled. "In fact you three look as though you
      were enjoying yourselves. How is the camp prospering, Robin, and how did
      you all sleep?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Jolly well." They were unanimous. "I saw your light, Mother," added Jan,
      "in the window."
    </p>

    <p>
      "My <i>light</i>, dear!" Mrs. Vaughan looked surprised; "my room looks out
      on the other side. I put out no lamp," she added when Jan had told her
      story; "you must have been mistaken."
    </p>

    <p>"Quite mysterious," said Peter teasingly.</p>

    <p>
      "Something <i>else</i> happened that seemed a bit mysterious at the time,
      didn't it, old chap?" said Robin, paying off Jan's score. "What about the
      noise at midnight?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, I'd forgotten all about it. So there was!" Peter broke into his
      story, and the experience lost nothing in the telling: "Bang, bang! Thump,
      thump! Ting, ting! it went," quoth he, "right through my head."
    </p>

    <p>
      His mother laughed. "The effect of the late supper, my dear; probably both
      mysteries come from the same cause. Well, I must go. Robin, remember
      you're in charge."
    </p>

    <p>
      "All right, Mother, but everything's going spiffingly, really," her eldest
      son assured her.
    </p>

    <p>
      The day was a busy one. First of all, the camp had to be cleared as the
      Captain commanded. Then came the making of the day's arrangements, and the
      procuring of supplies. Potatoes could be bought from a neighbouring farm;
      eggs also; butter and bread and tea from the village shop over the river.
      Jan was anxious to try her hand at a stew, and the meat for this had to be
      procured. Mrs. Brown's chores had to be put in hand too; old Brown was
      away early and the boys were anxious, as Scouts, to do as many good turns
      as they could for the kind old dame in return for her good services to
      them. Her wood was collected, and her kindling was chopped; her stores
      were brought in from the neighbouring shop; half-an-hour's work was put in
      on mending up the fence of her little garden. "And we'll have a go at
      earthing up your potatoes, Brownie, while we're on the Island," said
      Robin.
    </p>

    <p>
      After dinner and a rest the making of the "regular" hut began; the bivouac
      was only to be used until better accommodation was ready. A solid piece of
      work the making of the "Pioneer Hut"-as the boys called it-promised to be.
      First of all, a framework of tough ash branches, each one carefully
      chosen, would be needed; the ends of each must be pointed and fixed into
      holes in the ground, dug opposite to each other in two parallel lines, so
      that the whole framework, when completed, would look like a line of steady
      deeply-driven half-hoops of ash. A very strong branch had to be lashed to
      the top of the half-hoops to hold the whole together, and this must all be
      tested and tried before the thatching was even begun.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The whole thing will take some days at least," Robin remarked to his
      fellow-campers as they sat round their fire.
    </p>

    <p>"And when that's done, what'll we do next, I wonder?" remarked Peter.</p>

    <p>
      But a great many things were going to be done that no one among the
      campers had any expectation of whatever!
    </p>

    <br /><br /><br />

    <h3 style="text-align: center" id="chapter-06">CHAPTER VI</h3>

    <p>
      The hut was not finished for a week, and for seven whole days and nights
      there was not a drop of rain. Then, when at last the pioneer hut stood
      complete, taut and steady, thickly thatched and masterly in workmanship
      from framework to roof, the rain began.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just a drop at first, but the Scouts had been expecting it; the wind had
      shifted, and there was likelihood of a steady downpour for some time, as
      their weather-eyes told them. "It's really rather a chouse, though, just
      when the hut's ready, isn't it?" grumbled Peter, who hated to tear himself
      away from his newly completed handiwork.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The weather'll test it, anyway," remarked Robin, gazing at the little
      erection with critical eyes. "Now we shall know if the trench is really
      deep enough to carry away the water without soaking the place through, and
      whether that way of thatching really answers well, starting to thatch from
      the bottom and working up, so that the rain may drain off the side of the
      hut instead of drenching through."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, that's one way of looking at it, I suppose," said Peter more
      resignedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And I'll tell you what I think," said Jan, "I think it's a very good
      thing that the rain's begun early, if it had got to come. Brownie's got
      that lumber-room crammed with stuff, and a lot of hard work's got to be
      done by somebody or other before you boys can sleep there. And you'll have
      to, to-night, just look at the sky. Suppose we heap up the dixies and
      everything into the new hut, and go straight to the Cottage and turn to."
    </p>

    <p>
      In a very few minutes they had started acting on her suggestions. The rain
      was coming down now in large steady drops, and there was certainly every
      likelihood of a drenching night. The boys were not afraid of rain; they
      would have preferred to test the new hut's weather-proof properties by
      sleeping there through any weather, but they had given their word, and
      that was the end of the matter. The dixies were put away safely into the
      little hut, and the three set off in fairly good spirits for Island
      Cottage. After all, they had had a week's camping out already, and
      probably there were many more days and nights of it ahead for them; they
      would take one night's rest under a roof with as good a grace as they knew
      how.
    </p>

    <p>
      But an afternoon's good hard work lay between them and any possibility of
      a good night. The upstairs attic was a perfect chaos of muddled lumber;
      "and has been, my dears, since we came here," said Brownie, "fifteen years
      ago, as I remember well."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Who lived here before you, Brownie?" asked Robin. "It was a year before I
      was born, you see, so I don't remember."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sure, my dear, don't I remember that. 'Twas-well, 'twas young Hooker,
      gamekeeper he was, in your grandfather's days, but youngish for the job. I
      can see him now, a fine upstanding chap he was." The old dame heaved a
      sigh.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Young, was he? Why did he leave then? Where is he now?" inquired Peter
      standing still for a minute with an armful of boxes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sure, I can't tell you. 'Twas dismissed that he was. Into disgrace he
      fell, at the time of all the trouble," said Brownie. "Same age as
      Master--" she bustled away, muttering to herself.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Same age as <i>who</i>, Brownie?" inquired quick-eared Jan, who, armed
      with a duster and a mop, looked quite as busy as she really was.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the old woman did not appear to hear the question; she made for the
      door. "You'll be wanting your teas after all the help that you're giving,
      my dears, and the kettle's not on," she announced, and disappeared down
      the creaking stair.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There's certainly a mystery. A-choo!" Peter's voice began on an
      impressive note and finished up with a sneeze. "Begorra, what dust, Robin!
      What d'you think it means?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I-don't-know." Robin's voice sounded abstracted; he was gazing at a
      photograph that he held in his hand-an old, old faded snapshot of a young
      man fishing. "I-picked this up when a lot of rubbish fell down," he said;
      "but-who is it? It's taken on the Island by the river, and-it's like Dad.
      But-it's not the same smile. Much younger too, of course, but-whoever can
      it be?"
    </p>

    <p>"A relation, anyway," said Jan, peering over his shoulder.</p>

    <p>
      "I'll ask Brownie," said Peter, and, suiting the action, to the word, he
      seized the little portrait and made his way downstairs. "I say, who's
      this?" he inquired; "this man-is it an old picture of Dad, Brownie, d'you
      know? Because, well, it can't be, and yet--" He stopped and stared. "It's
      only a snapshot, Brownie; it's not a ghost," he continued, "nor a bomb,
      you know. Who is it?-that's all I was asking."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Aye, my dear, I hear right well what you're asking," said the old woman;
      "I see right well too that it's but a photograph, as you say. He and
      Hooker was always together; 'twas one of Hooker's taking, I make no doubt,
      seeing as it's upstairs still. Like David and Jonathan, so I've heard
      folks say, and--"
    </p>

    <p>"But-who is it?" inquired Peter, with wonder in his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Ah, my dear, sure and don't be asking me!" sobbed the old woman.</p>

    <br /><br /><br />

    <h3 style="text-align: center" id="chapter-07">CHAPTER VII</h3>

    <p>
      In spite of all the mysteries, however, and there certainly seemed to be a
      good many, the boys slept like tops in their attic-room that night.
      Perhaps it was as well "for their brains' sake," as Peter remarked, for
      they woke next morning to yet another mysterious affair.
    </p>

    <p>
      This time Jan had a story to tell, a story of
      <i>noise</i>. "A most peculiar noise, from the wall I think it was, or
      from the floor, Brownie, but I couldn't make out," she announced at
      breakfast-time. "Were you walking about in the night?"
    </p>

    <p>"No, indeed, my dear," said the old woman.</p>

    <p>
      "And you needn't ask <i>us</i>, for we didn't move all night," Peter
      assured her. "After all, there's something to be said for a jolly
      comfortable feather-bed after a week's outside camping. Though, of course,
      I'd rather sleep out of doors <i>any</i> day (or night, of course, I mean)
      than in a house."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, I don't know what <i>my</i> noise was then," said Jan; "I was
      hoping it was one of you. I am sure I was awake a whole hour listening to
      it and wondering. Like a banging and a tinging it sounded."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ting! ting! d'you mean? Why! perhaps it's like <i>my</i> noise," broke in
      Peter again, staring, "like the noise I heard when we were sleeping in
      camp."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Brownie, do <i>you</i> know what it was?" persisted Jan. "Have you ever
      heard it before?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "A noise, my dear, there once was, that some said--" the old woman checked
      herself. "<i>Never</i>, Miss Jan, have I heard such a sound as you name.
      <i>Mice</i> now, dearie, they make queer sounds," she added earnestly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But mice don't bang or ting," Jan remarked to Peter as they made their
      way again towards the camp. Somehow the three didn't feel satisfied about
      the matter. Robin certainly said little enough, but he "probably thought
      the more," as the others remarked. "We'd come down to your room and listen
      if it wasn't so rippingly fine," remarked Peter, "but the wind's veered
      right round and jolly weather's going to set in, though one doesn't know
      how long it will last with the suddenness of it. So it'd be downright
      silly to sleep indoors again, wouldn't it, unless you're really funkish,
      of course," he added considerately, "if you are--!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of course I'm not," said Jan bravely. After all, the fright of the night
      before had quite vanished with the morning light. She began to think that
      perhaps she had imagined the whole thing. "You see, after Brownie being so
      mysterious," she said, "and-well, everything,-I think perhaps I was just a
      bit silly."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Righto! I expect it was that," said Peter in brotherly tones as all three
      made their way down to the pioneer hut.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sound of Mrs. Vaughan's horn called them, however, before they could
      set to any kind of work. Every morning during the ten days' camp she had
      come to speak to them, and every day the bulletin had been a satisfactory
      one. Dick's scarlatina case seemed certainly to have been a very slight
      one, and nursing had not been arduous. To-day, as they rowed across, Mrs.
      Vaughan was looking extra cheerful and pleased.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, Dick's still progressing," she said; "he's really tired of being in
      bed, and he'll be up as soon as the rash has disappeared. Peeling will
      come next, I suppose. I've a piece of news for you to-day, however, which
      I had better give at once. Can you guess?"
    </p>

    <p>"Anything about Dad?" asked Peter.</p>

    <p>
      "No, it's Donald. He's out of quarantine now; it's ten days since he saw
      Dick, you see, and he's evidently not going to catch scarlet fever. So I
      thought of a plan which will, I hope, give pleasure to you all. I wrote to
      your aunt and told her what you three were doing, and suggested that
      Donald should join you on the Island. He's coming down to-morrow; I heard
      to-day. What do you think of that?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mother, it's perfectly ripping. What a splendiferous idea! And-we never
      thought of it!" There was no doubt about the satisfaction of the three.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, it's really a little hard on all of you, Donald as well, to have
      your holiday changed by the scarlet-fever business, so," Mrs. Vaughan
      smiled. "I'm glad you all approve. I spoke to Brown, and he was sure
      Brownie would welcome another. If seems that you're all more of helps than
      hindrances, he says, to his wife, and I'm glad to hear it. So another
      Scout will be no trouble to the old folk, I hope. The attic where you boys
      sleep is so big that another trundle-bed can be rigged up there,
      <i>if</i> there's a wet night again."
    </p>

    <p>
      "<i>If!</i> But I hope there won't be," said Peter, as they made their way
      back to camp. "I say-ripping, isn't it? We don't know him, but--"
    </p>

    <p>"Well, we know that he's a Scout," said Robin.</p>

    <p>
      "So he's sure to be thoroughly decent," said Jan, who adopted her
      brother's expressions when in need of extra words.
    </p>

    <p>
      And certainly Donald proved in the opinion of the three to be indeed
      "thoroughly decent" when, next afternoon, he arrived; a "jolly all-round
      man and a good Scout" the boys voted him, and Jan was quite as satisfied.
      Within an hour of his arrival he had been introduced into all the plans of
      the campers, and the four were seated round the fire roasting potatoes for
      supper as though they had been boon companions for years. "And you've the
      Pioneer Badge already?" exclaimed Robin, "as well as the ones we've got.
      And,-what's this?-Oh! the Signaller's Badge"; the boys were examining the
      proficiency badges that Donald wore on his right arm.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, Dick's a better signaller than I am," said Donald; "I wish he was
      here. He's jolly good and quick at flag-wagging; you should see him at it,
      and--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "You're both frightfully clever, I expect," said Peter. "Oh, I say, being
      cousins, you know, and all that, d'you think, Robin, that we could ask him
      about the mysteries?"
    </p>

    <br /><br /><br />

    <h3 style="text-align: center" id="chapter-08">CHAPTER VIII</h3>

    <p>
      "Mysteries!" Donald pricked up his ears. "Oh, I say, I'd like to hear
      them," and before Robin could exactly make up his mind on the matter, the
      subject was well under way. "There's-well there's a whole heap of
      mysteries," said Peter eagerly, "little ones and a big one. Brownie's in
      some of them, at least she certainly knows something about <i>one</i>, and
      I've an idea that she knows more than she'll own about your <i>noise</i>,
      Jan, if you ask me. And then there's my <i>noise</i>, and I--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "What on earth!" gasped their bewildered cousin, who felt almost
      suffocated with mysterious affairs already.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It does seem a bit muddly, I own," Peter grinned, "but we're properly
      muddled with them all, I can't tell you. First night we slept out Jan saw
      a light shining from the Chase windows; thought it was mother, and next
      morning thanked her politely for her beacon, only to hear that Mother had
      never thought of such a thing. Of course there might easily be an
      explanation of a <i>light</i>, but--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "But," interrupted Jan, eager to have something to say in the matter,
      "I've never seen it again, for I've looked. I wondered why; and besides, I
      believe it shone from one of the windows of the empty wing."
    </p>

    <p>"Some servant looking round last thing?" suggested Donald.</p>

    <p>
      "We've only two, and that's why the house is all shut up. They sleep at
      the back on the other side. Nobody goes round at night, but there might
      easily be an explanation of the light, I quite think-only, it certainly
      was there. Go on about your noise, Peter."
    </p>

    <p>
      "My noise happened at midnight or thereabout," said Peter, "I heard it
      hammering and tinging away. Thump! thump! Bang! bang! as I'm always
      telling everybody. Then it was gone. And Robin doesn't believe a word of
      it."
    </p>

    <p>"I don't say that," remarked his elder brother suddenly.</p>

    <p>
      "<i>What?</i>" Peter turned like a dart, "you're coming round, are you?
      How's that? You were so positive at first. Perhaps it's because Jan heard
      a noise last night?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "If you want to know the reason"-Robin stared into the fire,-"well, I
      happened to have heard it myself. Not the night that you did, Peter, but
      the next. You were asleep, and I lay and listened: it was a thumping and a
      banging and a tinging, as you say, and--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why in all the world didn't you tell us then?" demanded his younger
      brother.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I wanted to think," said Robin, "and-well I didn't hear it again. But, of
      course, Jan did, last night."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Was <i>she</i> sleeping out, then?" inquired their cousin, wrinkling his
      brows in thought. "I imagined that you said it was wet."
    </p>

    <p>
      "No, she never does. It's against orders. And that makes the whole thing
      queerer. <i>Our</i> noise was heard when we were camping, and didn't sound
      far off. It seemed to me to come through the ground, but, perhaps, that
      would be vibration, for a noise carries a long way if one puts one ear to
      the ground to listen," added Peter wisely. "<i>Jan's</i> noise, you know,
      was by her bed in the Cottage."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I <i>never</i> said so," remarked Jan eagerly; "from the wall or the
      floor, or both, I couldn't tell which-<i>that's</i> what I said!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Noises are queer things sometimes," was all the remark that Donald had to
      contribute apparently, a rather disappointing fact from the point of view
      of the three cousins, who had hoped for help from this distinguished
      Scout. "But, what other mysteries are there? They're most frightfully
      interesting, you know."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, aren't they? Well, there's Brownie's queer way of going on. First
      asking Mother if we'd be 'fr--'; the word was stuck in her throat by
      Mother's look, as I twigged, but she meant 'frightened'-frightened to
      sleep in the attic! Robin and me, you know, and we're
      <i>Scouts</i>. Why, for a minute I thought the place was haunted, and I
      felt inclined to give up the camp even, just to have a go at hunting the
      spooks, but Scouts don't believe in ghosts; and it wasn't that, it was
      something else!"
    </p>

    <p>"What?" inquired his cousin with interest.</p>

    <p>
      "Well, that's what we want to find out. The attic-place hadn't been swept
      out for years, and it's crammed with lumber, old bits of machinery and
      what not. There's some mystery about the former tenant of the Cottage, I'm
      almost sure; gamekeeper to Grandfather he was, you know. Dismissed, too,
      and gone somewhere that Brownie knows well enough, only she won't tell.
      Also, who's <i>this</i>?" Peter suddenly produced something out of his
      pocket and handed it across.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I say, Peter, I didn't think you'd hung on to that," interrupted Robin,
      "it's not yours. Besides, I don't know if--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "It's not <i>anybody's</i> except <i>Hooker's</i>! And I'll give it to him
      smart enough when I find him," answered his younger brother. "Brownie
      didn't ask for it, and it's not hers anyway, any more than it's mine. And,
      after all, Donald's a relation; he's not a stranger, is he? although we've
      never seen him before to-day; and--" he broke off as Donald turned.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There's no mystery exactly about this, as far as <i>I</i> can see," he
      said; "I've seen the picture before."
    </p>

    <p>"What! who is it then?" inquired the three.</p>

    <p>
      "Uncle Derrick-he's yours as well as ours, he's uncle to all of us, of
      course. Your father's brother, and my mother's brother"-there was rather a
      strange sound in Donald's voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But we've never heard about him, never in all our lives," moaned Peter,
      "and he looks so jolly sporting. Is he dead?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "No," Donald was beginning awkwardly, when Robin interrupted with
      authority. "Look here, Peter, you're to stow it. We'll ask Mother
      to-morrow, and if she's willing we'll go on. I'm Captain of this camp, and
      you're to obey orders, d'you understand?"
    </p>

    <br /><br /><br />

    <h3 style="text-align: center" id="chapter-09">CHAPTER IX</h3>

    <p>"I say, Mother, don't hurry off, wait a jiff, won't you?"</p>

    <p>
      The morning "confab" was over; the boat was pulled up close to the bank,
      and Mrs. Vaughan stood at the river-side; she was just turning to go back
      to the Chase when Robin's voice detained her. "What is it?" she asked,
      "Anything wrong? Are you sick of camping?
    </p>

    <p>
      "Rather not. It's something jolly different. It's--" Robin hesitated.
      "We're gradually finding out something," he said, "and we want to go on.
      It's about-- Mother, have we got an Uncle Derrick? For, if so, is there
      anything mysterious about him?"
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a minute's pause, then Mrs. Vaughan looked straight at the boys.
      "Who told you about him?" she asked slowly.
    </p>

    <p>"I'm afraid it was me. I didn't--" began Donald.</p>

    <p>
      "Mother, don't listen to him, it wasn't him," burst in Peter; "at least,
      just at the end, he told us that was who the photograph was of. But we've
      suspected something all along. Brownie's knowing something, and trying so
      hard not to let us twig, <i>that's</i> what has given it away. Then up in
      the attic there's Hooker's things!"
    </p>

    <p>"Hooker?" Mrs. Vaughan started, "what have you found out about him?"</p>

    <p>
      "Only that if there <i>is</i> an Uncle Derrick, he was Uncle Derrick's
      friend; that he was keeper in Grandfather's time, and that he was
      dismissed. And-Brownie won't tell us where he is," Robin spoke slowly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Also that he was a jolly sporting sort, the room's got ripping little
      engines and machinery sort of things about; he ought to have been a Scout.
      And that he could take jolly snapshots when you come to think that this
      has been lying round for fifteen years; and--" Peter stopped and held out
      the picture. "We found this, Mother," he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes... it's poor Uncle Derrick," said Mrs. Vaughan; she looked sadly at
      the picture for a minute, then she turned to the group. "Your father and I
      did not tell you," she said, "we wanted to keep sad things from you as
      long as we could. But perhaps we were not wise; Donald and Dick have
      evidently been told more than you know. Brown and his wife, too, know all
      the sad story, but-oh, I cannot tell you now, this is neither the time nor
      the place. Donald may tell you what his mother has told him; and you may
      ask Brownie. For every one loved your Uncle Derrick, and you will hear the
      story just as lovingly told by the old servants as I can tell it to you
      myself." Mrs. Vaughan turned, and still holding the little picture, she
      walked towards the Chase without turning, while the boat was rowed
      silently back to the other side of the water.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was not until after tea that old Brownie's story was told; all day the
      campers had half dreaded and half longed to hear the tale, for Donald knew
      little more than he had told them already, that there had been an Uncle
      Derrick, that there <i>was</i> an Uncle Derrick. Beyond that, the story
      was a mystery to him and Dick, as well as to the Vaughans. "Mother said we
      should know more some day," he told his cousins, "but I've never liked to
      ask."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, my dears," said old Brownie when they gave her the message, "tell
      you? Oh, my dears. But happen it's better not to keep the sad things hid,
      for they cut so deep, so deep! Your Uncle Derrick, my dears,-oh! he was
      the gayest, most open-handed that the sun shone on, handsome, kind and
      good to rich and poor. Aye, and true," the old woman nodded her head, "aye
      and <i>true</i>!
    </p>

    <p>
      "Him and Hooker was the same age; friends they'd been, though Hooker was
      but a village lad, from babyhood as you might say. But Master Derrick was
      like that. Together always, like David and Jonathan, both with the same
      passion, as boys, for fitting together bits of machinery, engines and such
      like, and all so clever. Your grandfather was proud of him, aye, and so
      were we all, servants too, but your grandfather was fonder of him, aye,
      perhaps than of either of the other two; pardon me, my dears, them being
      own father and mother to some of you. But so life is, sometimes. Master
      Derrick was like a Benjamin, so he was, to the Squire, coming late in life
      to him and all; he'd do anything for Master Derrick, would Squire. Gave
      the keeper's house to young Hooker, did he, young as Hooker was for to be
      keeper, just to please Master Derrick.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And there the pair used to spend hours of their time. When Master Derrick
      was a wee chap, 'twas always Hooker he followed; home from
      boarding-school, the same; he didn't forget old friends, and on they'd go
      with their inventions as they called them. Home from college, 'time Hooker
      had the cottage-then there they'd be down at the keeper's house,
      <i>this</i> house, here, my dears, and-that's how the bad end came!"
    </p>

    <p>"<i>What!</i>" whispered Jan with white lips.</p>

    <p>
      "Strange things were being said," went on the old woman, "and at that time
      strange false money was being passed in the county. Coiners were
      somewhere, and the evil couldn't be traced. Then scandal began to be
      afloat, though we heard naught of it till after; 'twas started, some said,
      by Mitchell, head keeper he'd been, and dismissed when Hooker took the
      job, and a grudge he'd always borne the lad. Folk spoke of the dear lads'
      inventions, and-well, my dears, to cut a long story short, the police from
      headquarters came down unexpected on this very cottage one night. Found
      what they called, I mind me, 'coiners' plant' in the wee room where Miss
      Jan sleeps, and in the attic-room above, where to this day I'm feared to
      heart of stopping long, 'twas there that they arrested the two."
    </p>

    <p>"Oh!" Peter's face went quite white. "Uncle Derrick! Was it?"</p>

    <p>
      "No!" the old woman's voice was firm, "neither of the dear lads was in it.
      Some spoke of Master Derrick's debts, and, well, some he may have had,
      open-handed as he was; but we know, as had served Squire from youth, and
      watched Master Derrick grow up. It was imprisonment that they got-seven
      years."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Where are they now? It's fifteen years ago," Robin's voice sounded
      strange, even to himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, my dears," Brownie dropped a slow, difficult tear, "that's the
      saddest part of it all."
    </p>

    <br /><br /><br />

    <h3 style="text-align: center" id="chapter-10">CHAPTER X</h3>

    <p>
      "Never a trace of them has there been since they were released from
      prison, never a trace. Out of the country they both went, so we think, and
      that's as far as we know. It was the death-blow to Squire, it was; but he
      died trusting in Master Derrick. Left him all his money too, did Squire;
      'as a proof,' so Squire said. Yes, the Chase went to your father, the
      Major, Master Robin, him being eldest son, my dear, but the money's
      waiting for Master Derrick when he comes home."
    </p>

    <p>
      The old woman's voice ceased, and there was silence. In the little room
      dusk had fallen while she had been speaking, for her story had been a long
      one. The firelight lit up the white faces of the four listeners, but none
      of them spoke: even Peter for once had nothing to say. Jan slipped her
      hand into Robin's, and he held it fast. "Poor Uncle Derrick!" said the
      little girl in a quivering voice, after a few minutes had passed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And sure, why <i>poor</i>?" Brownie's voice was husky but it was firm
      still. "'Twas naught of wrong that he did; nor Hooker, neither, for we
      <i>know</i>. They'll be coming back, an' wrongful punishment cannot smirch
      the innocent, my dears. Please God, I shall see them, too; please God
      they'll come in my time; but that they will come back, I <i>know</i>."
      There was silence again for a minute or two, and then the spell that
      seemed laid on the little group by the telling of the old woman's story
      was suddenly broken by a sound outside. Old Brown clamped noisily into the
      kitchen, kicking the earth from his boots on the step outside. "I've been
      down to th' hut, wife," said he, "but the young folks hain't thereabouts.
      Happen ye know where they'll be?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "We're here!" The four came out of the shadows, feeling glad in a way of
      the interruption, for the story was too dreadfully sad to them to be
      thought of too long. "D'you want us, Brown?" asked Robin.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Aye, sir, 'tis a message. There's a telegraft come this night. Your
      mother, sir, would have spoke to you herself, she bid me say, but she's
      right-down busy. The Major's expecting leave, and--"
    </p>

    <p>"Dad!" Three voices were raised in excited chorus.</p>

    <p>
      "Aye, my dears, 'tis good news, that's certain. He's hoping to be home
      come Saturday. Your mother, sir, she was fair set about at first on
      account of the scarlet fever, but she's talked it over with the Doctor.
      They've arranged to move the young gentleman into the old wing. 'We'll
      disinfect the rest of the house for three whole days,' so madam said, and
      Doctor, he agreed; 'and then 'twill be right enow,' said madam, 'what wi'
      sulphur-burning, and such like.' Aye, they've fires lighted, and 'tis all
      under way, and they're moving Master Dick this night." The old man hobbled
      to his favourite chair.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Hurrah, but it's late!" Robin got up and shook himself. "We must go back
      to camp and see that the fire hasn't burned too low. We'll soon boil up a
      dixie and get some supper ready. Coming?" he called to the others.
    </p>

    <p>
      But as the four made their way across the Island to the camp in the dusk
      they spoke not at all. Brownie's story had made such a deep impression on
      every one of them that they hardly knew how to mention it even to each
      other. Even after Jan had been escorted home, and supper was over, and the
      boys lay stretched in the blue-darkness of the summer night, the topic
      upper-most in their minds was not touched upon between them.
    </p>

    <p>"Jolly ripping that Dad's coming home, anyway," said Peter at last.</p>

    <p>
      "Rather," said Robin. Then a silence fell. The three boys lay under the
      stars and thought before finally they fell asleep; each one was thinking
      too of the same thing, of Uncle Derrick's story.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I saw my light again last night," announced Jan next morning as she fried
      up the remains of some cold potatoes for a breakfast dish, wielding the
      frying-pan with dexterous hand.
    </p>

    <p>"You <i>did</i>?" All the boys were eagerly listening.</p>

    <p>
      "In exactly the same place, but a brighter light this time; and it lasted
      longer, too. It didn't come and go like before; it stayed alight till ten
      o'clock, and then went out, for I timed it by my watch."
    </p>

    <p>"Show us whereabouts," suggested Peter.</p>

    <p>
      "I can, for I looked particularly. It was a pretty dark night, but the
      moon came out from behind a cloud once, and I could make out the outline
      of the Chase. The light was from the last window of the east wing. I'm
      going when breakfast's done, to look at the place again."
    </p>

    <p>
      But when at last breakfast <i>was</i> over the results of the
      investigation seemed to be rather disappointing, considered in the light
      of a possible mystery. The window in question looked over the river, and
      could plainly be seen from the Island. A white curtain stretched across
      the panes, and a fern plant stood on a table in the window. "I don't think
      there's much reason why there shouldn't be a light from <i>that</i> room
      <i>every</i> night of the year without causing mysteries," announced
      Donald. "It's plainly a bedroom, or something!"
    </p>

    <p>
      But the three Vaughans were staring open-mouthed. "It's-why it must be the
      room they've moved Dick into!" remarked Peter at last. "It looks as though
      it's come alive in the night, doesn't it? It gave me quite a shock;
      <i>that's</i> why you saw the light last night, Jan-no mystery at all!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "But," Jan was persistent, "even if that
      <i>does</i> explain last night's light-and I suppose it
    </p>

    <br /><br /><br />

    <h3 style="text-align: center" id="chapter-11">CHAPTER XI</h3>

    <p>
      The three days before Major Vaughan's return promised to pass on leaden
      wings, but in reality they flew merrily enough. Not only was there a
      general furbishing-up of the camp to be seen to, for "Dad," as the boys
      said, "was sure to be as jolly keen on it as they were," but a new and
      unexpected occupation suddenly presented itself to the company.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hitherto Dick had been considered in the light of an un-get-at-able
      invalid, who could be written to, and to whom messages might be sent
      through Mrs. Vaughan, but who was, otherwise, as inaccessible as though he
      had been still at his home in the far north. Now, however, with the
      removal of the convalescent to the "river-room" in the east wing, things
      changed. From breakfast till bedtime the now recovering invalid stood
      glued to his bedroom window watching with interested eyes practically
      everything that the campers were doing. The Cottage was in full view of
      his window, so was the camp fire. "It seems strange, doesn't it?" said
      Peter, "that there's Dick looking on, and here are we, feeling awfully
      chummy with him, and all that, but we've never spoken to him in our
      lives!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Good idea!" shouted Donald; into the hut he raced, appearing presently
      with a flag with which he began signalling to his brother. The latter
      seemed to twig the idea instantly; he disappeared from the window, and
      appeared again, bearing what was certainly nothing more or less than a
      bath-towel; vigorous flag-wagging ensued between the brothers for a few
      minutes, while the Vaughans looked interestedly on.
    </p>

      "I say," said Robin, "you can do Morse like lightning. I could hardly
      follow half of it. No wonder you've got your Signalling Badges! What were
      you saying?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I asked him how he found himself this morning, and he says that he feels
      topping, and never better, and wishes the peeling were over, and would
      give a jolly lot to be camping with the rest of us," explained Donald.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Let me have a try," begged Peter; but his skill in signalling was slight;
      and Robin, who tried next, had had little experience. Donald tried again.
      "I say, he says," he interpreted after a vigorous few minutes, "that you
      two need practice, and he says why don't you let him practice with you
      while he's shut up there with nothing to do. You'd probably soon pass your
      tests if you did. Minimum is 24 letters per minute for Morse, you know,
      and 36 for Semaphore. He knows both, and he'd coach you from his side, and
      I'd coach you here."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Rather!" the three Vaughans were unanimous. "There's a Signaller's Badge
      for Guides, too!" said Jan. "I say, what fun!"
    </p>

    <p>
      By the time that dusk fell on the evening of the first day, hiding the
      east wing signaller from his pupils, the latter had certainly gained
      ground after a hard day's work. Next morning, before breakfast, Peter,
      after flying out with his flag to bid Dick good-morning, returned to the
      rest of his camping companions with rather a queer look on his face. "Come
      on, Donald," he said, "you're wanted. I can't exactly twig what Dick's
      saying, he's so jolly quick about it. But it's something about 'noises,'
      I'm pretty sure; and I <i>think</i> he says that he's heard queer noises
      in the night!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "He does," announced Donald, after conversing with his brother. "It's
      strange isn't it? but he says he's been kept awake by them. He says that
      he wants to know if the east wing supposed to be haunted!"
    </p>

    <p>"Ask what kind of a noise?" suggested Jan.</p>

    <p>"He says 'thumps and bangs,'" reported Donald.</p>

    <p>"WELL!!!!" chorused the others in amazement.</p>

    <p>
      "My light on the first night," added Jan suddenly; "it shone from there.
      <i>Now</i>, who says that it wasn't mysterious?"
    </p>

    <p>
      There was little chance of signalling practice for the rest of that day,
      for rain came down in buckets as soon as breakfast was over and the mist
      quite blotted out the Chase from the Islanders. Night must be spent at
      Island Cottage, there was no doubt about that. "And I do hope it'll be
      fine to-morrow," said Peter, as the three boys undressed that night in the
      big attic upstairs. "Dad's to get here early in the morning, and it would
      be such a--"
    </p>

    <p>
      Tap! tap! came at their door, and Jan's face appeared; her eyes were
      bright and her teeth were chattering. "Oh, I'm so glad that you're
      sleeping here to-night," she said, "because-"
    </p>

    <p>"What's up?" inquired the boys.</p>

    <p>
      "It's-my room; the noise again; only it's louder: thumps this time, and
      loud bangs, and-near. On the wall, I think, or behind the wall, and from
      near to the floor. Some one's knocking, I'm certain, and I think I heard a
      voice!"
    </p>

    <p>
      It didn't take an instant for the boys to slip on their coats. In another
      they were on the stairs on their way to Jan's room. There was silence for
      a minute or two after they entered; then the rapping began again. From the
      wall near the fireplace it seemed to come. Then there was the sound of a
      voice, "Let me out;" the words were faint, but perfectly plain.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, we will. Don't lose heart," Robin's tones sounded clear in the
      little room. He dropped on his knees beside the wall: "Tell us what to do,
      and we can help you."
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a pause, and then the voice very faintly came again: "Make
      haste, or-pull out the mantel-shelf; that's the way. Keep it straight as
      you pull, and-pull hard; I will push from here, but I have not much
      strength left!" Then followed a moment of tense suspense, while the boys
      followed the directions; then came a grinding noise, and a long creaking
      movement of the front of the fireplace; then came a cry from Jan.

    <h3 style="text-align: center" id="chapter-12">CHAPTER XII</h3>

    <p>
      "My dears," said Mrs. Vaughan; she had just left Island Cottage and she
      was seated outside the pioneer hut beside the camp-fire with the four
      beside her. "Yes, there has been a thorough disinfection, and Dr. Greig
      says it is quite safe for me to see you out of doors. Tell me about it.
      And Jan, how pale you look."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was-last night, seeing the old man, he looked so ill, so dreadful when
      he came through the door." Jan's voice trembled.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was only just in time, you see, Mother," Robin spoke; "in five more
      minutes he wouldn't have had the strength even to call or rap again. He
      was in dreadful pain, it was his heart."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, dear, Dr. Greig has told me; he is there still, and I have just seen
      him." Mrs. Vaughan spoke slowly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "How he came there we don't know a bit,-how he knew of the secret door;
      for it must be one, and it must lead somewhere. He-well he asked for
      <i>Dad</i>, said that he was dying and that he had a confession to make,
      and," Peter stopped for a minute, "then Robin went off for Dr. Greig."
    </p>

    <p>
      "That was right." Mrs. Vaughan looked up. "You ask me who he is, and about
      his confession. It is a long story, some of which you have heard before
      from Brownie, but you must know it. Does it make things any plainer to you
      if I tell you that the old man who is dying at the Cottage is called
      Mitchell?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mitchell!" The boys looked at each other. "We've heard the name-didn't
      Brownie-?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "It's the name of the gamekeeper before Hooker," exclaimed Jan suddenly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes. Mitchell, long ago, was your grandfather's head keeper; he was
      unsatisfactory, and so was dismissed. Hooker was given his situation and
      his cottage by Uncle Derrick's request, and for that reason Mitchell bore
      a grudge against the two-not only on account of his dismissal, but the
      Cottage had become necessary to him owing to some underhand work that he
      had been carrying on there for some time. For a year at least before his
      dismissal he had been making false money, which had been circulated
      through the county; he had discovered a secret smugglers' passage leading
      from the east wing, under the Island, to the other side of the river,
      which opened also into one of the rooms in his cottage, and in this secret
      place his coining was carried on.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Even after Hooker came into possession of the Cottage, Mitchell still
      carried on this work; he felt secure in his underground shelter; and it
      was not until the false money had been detected and inquiries began to be
      put on foot that he feared arrest. <i>Then</i> he paid back the grudge
      that he had nursed for months against Uncle Derrick and young Hooker; he
      managed to enter by night, unseen, through the secret entrance into the
      Cottage; there he left some part of his coining plant, which would be
      indisputable evidence against the person in whose possession it might be
      found. He wrote an anonymous letter to the Police Headquarters suggesting
      that they should search Hooker's cottage, and the deed was done. Brownie
      has told you how Uncle Derrick and Hooker were arrested, and--" Mrs.
      Vaughan stopped.
    </p>

    <p>"But how do you know this?" Robin asked hoarsely.</p>

    <p>
      "Mitchell has confessed to Dr. Greig in the presence of old Brown. I have
      read the confession which was made last night. Fifteen years have passed
      since his first attempts at coining, and it seems that he thought he would
      attempt the same thing again. For some weeks now, so he says, he has
      worked in the underground passage. Last night he was suddenly seized with
      a dreadful heart attack-for years he has been the victim of heart
      disease-and, not having strength to get through the passage to the other
      side of the river, he tried to make his way through into the Cottage for
      help, as he knew it was his last chance. He is dying and he has confessed;
      God will be merciful to him, and will help us to think mercifully of him
      too."
    </p>

    <p>"Oh, Mother, and poor Uncle Derrick." Jan's voice shook.</p>

    <p>
      "Listen," Mrs. Vaughan spoke again, "I have other news for you. Last night
      a letter came from Father; he has delayed his coming for a few hours so
      that I might read his letter first. He is not coming alone, children, he
      is bringing with him a friend-an officer of the Australian contingent, who
      has won the V.C. under circumstances of extraordinary bravery. This
      officer, it was, who at the risk of his life stayed beside his wounded
      orderly, whom he would not leave though enemy fire was raining around them
      for a day and a night. His right arm is gone"-Mrs. Vaughan's voice
      shook-"but his orderly's life was saved."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mother," Jan spoke breathlessly, "Uncle Derrick is the Australian
      officer, he-<i>is</i>."
    </p>

    <p>"And Hooker's the orderly," said Peter very gruffly.</p>

    <p>
      "Look," broke in Robin suddenly; and on the other side of the river a
      little group of three was seen to be approaching the boat that would take
      them over to the Island. Major Vaughan was there; with him a tall,
      one-armed officer, and, behind them a little, came the form of another
      soldier. "Oh, Mother," said Peter, "Oh!"
    </p>

    <p>
      But no one else could say a word; for it was all too wonderful ... Uncle
      Derrick had come home.
    </p>
